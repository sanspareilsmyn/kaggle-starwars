# Friends Recommendation System with Star Wars Social Network

1. Project Intro  

Star Wars series is awesome! It is one of the most greatest fictional worlds existing in our culture.  
What if characters in Star Wars used Facebook? What if characters in Star Wars series would be recommended each other?  
Let's make this happen by programming awesome codes!  

I've used Star Wars Social Network dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/star-wars?select=starwars-episode-2-interactions.json)!
